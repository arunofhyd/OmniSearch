Omni Search is a powerful, native macOS Shortcut utility designed to eliminate the friction of context switching. It provides a centralized, persistent search window that intelligently routes your queries to the right tools—without cluttering your browser tabs.

---

## Why Omni Search?

- **🚀 Zero Friction**: Highlight text anywhere, trigger the shortcut, and get results instantly. No new tabs, no window hunting.
- **🛡️ Native Utility**: Built entirely on Apple Shortcuts and AppleScript. No third-party apps, no background daemons, no data logging.
- **🧠 Intelligent Routing**: Context-aware routing sends your search to Google, Apple Music, PubMed, or internal enterprise tools based on your selection.
- **🔒 Enterprise Ready**: Includes advanced URL sanitization to bypass strict WAFs (e.g., Apple Marketing Tools) and robust session handling for Safari restarts.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- macOS Monterey (12.0) or later.
